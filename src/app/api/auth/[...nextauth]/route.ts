export { GET, POST } from "@/auth";

//? We don't need to create it like this, it is for outside servers.
//? So it's enough to import {GET, POST} from auth, which is from github
//? We can change our data with server actions, so no need following code:

// export async function GET(){
    
// }  

// export async function POST(){

// }
